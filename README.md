## Requirements:
It is necessary to make an application from two modules (application design is not important):
- list (displays any data received from the API)
- details (you can jump from the list)
- Any open service (github, flickr, giphy) can be used as an API.
- The advantage of having at least a few unit tests for any class.

## Tech stack: 
- Xcode >= 13.0
- Minimum iOS Deployment Target: 13.0
